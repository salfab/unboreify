# Playlist Tools Test Organization

## Overview
The playlist tools functionality now has its own dedicated test file for better organization and maintainability.

## Test Files

### 📁 `cypress/e2e/features/playlist_tools.feature`
**New dedicated feature file for playlist tools testing**

Covers:
- ✅ Playlist Tools page accessibility and navigation
- ✅ Playlist Diff tool interface and functionality  
- ✅ All 5 diff modes (intersection, base-only, target-only, symmetric-diff, union)
- ✅ Save to Spotify playlist functionality
- ✅ Dialog interactions and error handling
- ✅ Loading states and empty results
- ✅ Navigation between tools and back to main page

### 📁 `cypress/support/step_definitions/playlist_tools.steps.ts`
**Comprehensive step definitions for playlist tools**

Includes:
- Page navigation and verification steps
- Playlist selection and comparison steps
- Diff mode testing steps
- Save functionality steps
- Loading and error state steps
- Dialog interaction steps

### 📁 `cypress/e2e/features/app_features.feature`
**Cleaned up - playlist tools tests moved out**

Now focuses on:
- Core app features (FestiClub, Queue management)
- General application functionality
- Non-playlist-specific features

## Test Data
- Uses existing fixtures: `user-playlists.json` and `sample-playlist.json`
- Fixtures support multiple playlists for comparison testing
- Includes realistic track data for diff operations

## Benefits of This Organization

1. **🎯 Focused Testing**: Each feature file has a clear scope
2. **📝 Better Maintainability**: Easier to find and update playlist-specific tests
3. **🔄 Reusable Steps**: Step definitions are more modular and reusable
4. **📊 Clear Reporting**: Test results are grouped by feature area
5. **🚀 Scalability**: Easy to add more playlist tools without cluttering other tests
